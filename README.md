# Multiple_Lineer_Regression_Model
> **Description**: This code is a multiple linear model created using data provided by Kaggle.

This model, which I created for educational purposes, is based on predicting students' exam scores based on certain features. The code is written cleanly and descriptively. The libraries *Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn* were used for testing. The relevant data was tested both with the ready-made **gradient_descent** function provided by Scikit-learn and with custom functions I wrote.
